# Problem 4 - Convert To Greyscale - this is optional!

**This problem is optional. Solve it only if you can!**

**You can apply with the previous 3 tasks.**

In a programming language of your choice, implement the following function/method:
```
convertToGreyscale(imgPath)
```
Given the path of a color image (.jpg, .png, .bmp) create a greyscale version of it and save it.

## Examples
**original**

![original](images/john-romero.jpg)

**greyscale**

![greyscale](images/john-romero-greyscale.jpg)

**WARNING!** You are not allowed to use any libraries, you have to write your own algorithm!
